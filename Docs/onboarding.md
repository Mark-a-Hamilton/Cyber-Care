# Cyber Care Onboarding

Welcome to Cyber Care—a framework for ethical, transparent, and auditable cybersecurity delivery. Whether you're a client seeking clarity or a contributor joining the mission, this onboarding guide will help you navigate the principles, tools, and workflows that define our approach.

## 🧭 Audience Segmentation

Cyber Care supports two primary audiences:

- **Clients**: Non-technical stakeholders who require cybersecurity services they can understand, trust, and verify.
- **Contributors**: Technical professionals who uphold operational hygiene, ethical boundaries, and traceable workflows.

Each audience receives tailored onboarding flows, empathy-driven documentation, and modular access to relevant tools.

## 💡 Empathy Profiles

We recognize that trust is built through understanding. Cyber Care uses empathy profiles to guide tone, documentation depth, and interface design:

| Profile Type     | Needs                            | Approach                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Curious Client   | Clarity, reassurance, control    | Plain-English docs, RoE summaries |
| Concerned Client | Privacy, consent, transparency   | VC logs, scope declarations       |
| New Contributor  | Structure, traceability, support | Modular workflows, audit trails   |
| Senior Contributor | Autonomy, consistency, ethics  | Metadata standards, RoE logic     |
