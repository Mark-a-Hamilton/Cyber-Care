# Cyber Care Overview

Cyber Care is a client-facing wrapper for Recon-Suite, designed to deliver cybersecurity services that are ethical, transparent, and accessible to non-technical audiences. It reframes technical operations into trustable workflows, empowering both clients and contributors through clarity, modularity, and audit-grade traceability.

## üéØ Mission & Ethical Framing

Cybersecurity should protect without intruding, inform without overwhelming, and empower without assuming. Cyber Care exists to:

- **Demystify cybersecurity** for clients through plain-English documentation and visual metaphors.
- **Embed ethical boundaries** into every module via Rules of Engagement (RoE) and privilege-aware scripting.
- **Enable contributor autonomy** with modular workflows, rollback protocols, and VC logging standards.
- **Ensure auditability** by harmonizing metadata, consent logs, and scope declarations across all tools.

We believe cybersecurity is not just a technical service‚Äîit‚Äôs a civic responsibility.
