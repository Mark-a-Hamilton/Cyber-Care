# Cyber Care Overview

Cyber Care is a client-facing wrapper for Recon-Suite, designed to deliver cybersecurity services that are ethical, transparent, and accessible to non-technical audiences. It reframes technical operations into trustable workflows, empowering both clients and contributors through clarity, modularity, and audit-grade traceability.

The links in this document demonstrate how Cyber Care principles apply in a cybersecurity context. These links are relevant to the CyberSecurity application. However the model is designed to be domain-agnostic and adaptable to any system requiring ethical, transparent, and modular design.

## üéØ Mission & Ethical Framing

Cybersecurity should protect without intruding, inform without overwhelming, and empower without assuming. Cyber Care exists to:

- **Demystify cybersecurity** for clients through plain-English documentation and visual metaphors.
- **Embed ethical boundaries** into every module via Rules of Engagement (RoE) and privilege-aware scripting.
- **Enable contributor autonomy** with modular workflows, rollback protocols, and VC logging standards.
- **Ensure auditability** by harmonizing metadata, consent logs, and scope declarations across all tools.

We believe cybersecurity is not just a technical service‚Äîit‚Äôs a civic responsibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Summary

Cyber Care supports two primary flows:

### For Clients
- Review the [RoE.md](./roe-2.md) to understand scope, consent, and privilege boundaries.
- Approve modules via versioned consent logs.
- Monitor remediation status through live VC logs.
- Submit feedback or scope revisions via the onboarding interface.

### For Contributors
- Clone the repo and follow [Setup.md](../setup.md).
- Use [Workflow.md](./workflow.md) to execute modules with rollback and logging.
- Follow [RoE.md](./roe.md) to respect ethical boundaries and escalation logic.
- Log actions using standardized VC metadata blocks.
- Suggest improvements via Issues or Pull Requests.

## ü§ñ AI Involvement & Transparency

Cyber Care integrates AI support for:

- **Documentation scaffolding** ‚Äì Generating stubs, summaries, and empathy-driven onboarding flows.
- **Logic validation** ‚Äì Modeling RoE clauses as decision trees or formal predicates.
- **Contributor empowerment** ‚Äì Offering modular diagnostics, privilege-aware scripting, and ethical framing.

All AI-generated content is versioned, reviewable, and subject to contributor oversight. Transparency is not optional‚Äîit‚Äôs architectural.

## üìö Applying Cyber Care Beyond Cybersecurity  
While this repo demonstrates Cyber Care in a cybersecurity context, the model is domain-agnostic. Contributors are encouraged to adapt the framework to other systems‚Äîlegal, civic, educational‚Äîusing the cybersecurity example as a learning scaffold.

Cyber Care is a living framework. Every module, document, and decision tree is designed to evolve‚Äîwith clarity, traceability, and contributor care at its core.
