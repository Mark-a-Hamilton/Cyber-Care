**Contributor:** Mark-a-Hamilton  
**Module:** Cyber Care Documentation  
**Task Card:** [Circular References · Cyber Care](https://github.com/users/Mark-a-Hamilton/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=125648767&issue=Mark-a-Hamilton%7CCyber-Care%7C3)  
**Sprint:** 1 — Foundational Integrity  

#### ✅ Summary of Changes  
- Audited all `.md` files for internal link integrity  
- Verified circular reference structure: each document links to at least two others  
- Ensured backlinks to `README.md` or `Foundation.md` are present  
- Confirmed anchor links resolve correctly across files  
- Enabled non-linear contributor onboarding from any entry point  

#### 📚 Rationale  
Circular references support ethical onboarding, traceability, and modular clarity. Contributors can now explore the Cyber Care model from any document and reach the full context without relying on linear navigation. This reinforces autonomy, transparency, and operational hygiene.

#### 🧭 Impact  
- Strengthens contributor empowerment and onboarding flow  
- Demonstrates ethical design principles in documentation structure  
- Aligns with Cyber Care’s mission of accessible, auditable cybersecurity delivery  
- Prepares groundwork for future visual navigation tools or onboarding maps

- [Workflow](./workflow.md)  

#### 🧾 Notes  
- Consider adding `Navigation.md` to explicitly document circular logic for future contributors  
- All changes harmonized with existing VC metadata blocks and contributor clarity standards
