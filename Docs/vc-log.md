# Version Control Log

### üóìÔ∏è 2025-08-24  

#### ‚úÖ Summary of Changes  
- Audited all `.md` files for internal link integrity  
- Verified circular reference structure: each document links to at least two others  
- Ensured backlinks to `README.md` or `Foundation.md` are present  
- Confirmed anchor links resolve correctly across files  
- Enabled non-linear contributor onboarding from any entry point  

#### üìö Rationale  
Circular references support ethical onboarding, traceability, and modular clarity. Contributors can now explore the Cyber Care model from any document and reach the full context without relying on linear navigation. This reinforces autonomy, transparency, and operational hygiene.

#### üß≠ Impact  
- Strengthens contributor empowerment and onboarding flow  
- Demonstrates ethical design principles in documentation structure  
- Aligns with Cyber Care‚Äôs mission of accessible, auditable cybersecurity delivery  
- Prepares groundwork for future visual navigation tools or onboarding maps  

#### üîó Related Files  
- [README.md](../README.md)  
- [Overview](./overview.md)
- [Rules of Engagement](./roe.md)
- [Workflow](./workflow.md)  

#### üßæ Notes  
- Consider adding `Navigation.md` to explicitly document circular logic for future contributors  
- All changes harmonized with existing VC metadata blocks and contributor clarity standards

### üóìÔ∏è 2025-08-24 - Circular References Task Card Closed  
All `.md` files now feature internal links supporting circular navigation.  
Contributor onboarding is modular and traceable from any entry point.  
`vc-log.md` has been created and timestamped.  
No broken or orphaned links remain.  
Optional enhancements (e.g., backlinking `vc-log.md`) noted but not blocking.  
Task card marked as complete.

## 2025-08-24 19:22 BST - Foundation.md Completion

### Summary:
Completed initial draft of `foundation.md`, establishing the conceptual roots of the CYBERCARE model. Document outlines key influences including OOPPs, SDLC, and the Waterfall/Spiral models. Emphasizes the transition from legacy software engineering frameworks to a modular, ethical system designed for contributor empowerment and operational clarity.

### Rationale:
This entry marks the formal articulation of CYBERCARE‚Äôs foundational philosophy. It supports the Model Evolution objective by providing a teachable origin story and framing the model as both technically rigorous and personally reflective. The document is written in plain English to ensure accessibility for non-technical stakeholders.

### Next Steps:
- Add cross-links to `README.md`, `RoE.md`, and `Workflow.md` for continuity
- Reference Recon-Suite modules to show ethical scaffolding lineage
- Optionally include diagrams or visual analogies to aid onboarding

## 2025-08-24 19:28 BST - Circular Reference Confirmation

Confirmed that `README.md` links to `foundation.md`, `RoE.md`, and `Workflow.md`, completing the circular reference structure. This satisfies the continuity requirement in the Model Evolution checklist and supports non-linear onboarding.

‚úÖ Checklist Item Completed:
- Link to relevant documentation (README.md, RoE.md, Workflow.md) to show continuity

üìö Impact:
- Strengthens contributor navigation
- Reinforces modular documentation integrity
- Aligns with Cyber Care‚Äôs ethical onboarding principles

üóìÔ∏è **2025-08-24**  

‚úÖ **Summary of Changes**  
Updated `usecases.md` to remove references to specific Recon-Suite modules. Reframed the document to invite open-ended exploration of the public Recon-Suite repo, emphasizing modularity and contributor autonomy.

üìö **Rationale**  
Prescriptive links were replaced with an open invitation to explore, aligning with Cyber Care‚Äôs ethos of ethical onboarding and non-linear learning. This change supports contributor empowerment by encouraging curiosity and self-directed discovery.

üß≠ **Impact**  
- Reinforces modular documentation principles  
- Strengthens alignment with Cyber Care‚Äôs ethical design philosophy  
- Prepares groundwork for future onboarding maps or visual navigation tools  
- Supports Model Evolution by showcasing the shift from directive to exploratory framing

üîó **Related Files**  
- `usecases.md`  
- `README.md`  
- `Foundation.md`  

üìù **Notes**  
Consider adding a visual onboarding map or contributor journey diagram in future sprints to complement the open-ended exploration model.
