# Use Cases

## 🔗 [Exploring Cyber Care Through Recon-Suite](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/README.md)

Cyber Care is built on modular, auditable principles—many of which were first prototyped in Recon-Suite. This document invites you to explore the **public Recon-Suite repository**, which outlines the conceptual backbone of Cyber Care.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The public Recon-Suite repo showcases the model’s structure and philosophy. Detailed implementation—including privileged diagnostics and contributor tooling—resides in a private repository to uphold security and responsible stewardship.

### 🧭 Explore Freely

Rather than prescribing specific modules, we encourage you to navigate the public repository with curiosity. Each tool reflects Cyber Care’s core values:

- **Transparency** – Every action is traceable and explainable  
- **Empowerment** – Contributors can understand and extend tools without gatekeeping  
- **Modularity** – Each component is self-contained yet interoperable  

Start anywhere. Follow your instincts. The repo is designed to reward exploration.

Here’s a new use case entry for `usecases.md` that aligns with CyberCare’s modular tone and civic transparency, while guiding contributors toward the military module:

### 🛡️ Strategic Defense Use Case: Navigating the Military Module

CyberCare’s military module demonstrates how modular, ethical tooling can be applied to national defense. Built on the same principles as Recon-Suite—transparency, traceability, and contributor empowerment—it offers a framework for detecting and responding to threats without initiating conflict.

This use case explores how CyberCare:

- Uses aerial and subsurface drone nets to detect hostile acts before they escalate  
- Applies martial arts philosophy (Aikido) to strategic deterrence—turning adversary momentum into liability  
- Maintains democratic integrity by ensuring all responses are proportional and ethically justified  
- Reinforces civic trust by making defense logic auditable and teachable  

🧭 **To explore this module**, start with [`military/introduction.md`](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Cyber-Care/blob/main/Docs/usecases.md), which outlines the strategic framing, ethical boundaries, and operational scaffolding. From there, contributors can navigate to:

- `military/evolution.md` — for historical context and philosophical rationale  
- `military/hardware.md` — for modular assets and deployment logic  
- `military/traffic-light.md` — for situational scale and response classification  

This use case is ideal for contributors interested in strategic deterrence, ethical defense tooling, and civic demonstration through modular design.

Let me know if you'd like this staged for commit or cross-linked from `concept.md` as well. We could also scaffold a `military-usecase.md` for deeper contributor orientation.
