## üîó Linking Cyber Care to Recon-Suite

Cyber Care is built on modular, auditable principles‚Äîmany of which were first prototyped in Recon-Suite. This document links to example modules that demonstrate how ethical cybersecurity can be delivered in practice.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The linked Recon-Suite repository is public and outlines the conceptual framework only. Detailed implementation, including privileged diagnostics and contributor tooling, resides in a private repository for security and stewardship reasons.

### üß™ Example Modules (Public Recon-Suite)
- [Recon-Suite README](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/README.md): Check me!! 
- [`recon-home`](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/recon-home/README.md): Local system health checks (disk clean, defrag, uptime logging)
- [`vc-log`](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/vc-log/README.md): Version control logging with contributor-friendly metadata blocks
- [`diagnostics`](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/diagnostics/README.md): Privilege-aware diagnostics for cross-platform troubleshooting

These modules reflect Cyber Care‚Äôs core values:
- **Transparency**: Every action is logged and explainable
- **Empowerment**: Contributors can understand and extend tools without gatekeeping
- **Modularity**: Each tool is self-contained but interoperable

If you're a contributor or stakeholder, feel free to explore these modules to understand how Cyber Care translates ethical theory into operational clarity.

Would you like to add a VC-log entry for this linkage, or scaffold a contributor note explaining why the private repo remains closed-source? I can also help draft a permissions philosophy if you're preparing for stakeholder review.
