## 🔗 Exploring Cyber Care Through Recon-Suite

Cyber Care is built on modular, auditable principles—many of which were first prototyped in Recon-Suite. This document invites you to explore the **public Recon-Suite repository**, which outlines the conceptual backbone of Cyber Care.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The public Recon-Suite repo showcases the model’s structure and philosophy. Detailed implementation—including privileged diagnostics and contributor tooling—resides in a private repository to uphold security and responsible stewardship.

### 🧭 Explore Freely

Rather than prescribing specific modules, we encourage you to navigate the public repo **[public repository](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/README.md)** with curiosity. Each tool reflects Cyber Care’s core values:

- **Transparency** – Every action is traceable and explainable  
- **Empowerment** – Contributors can understand and extend tools without gatekeeping  
- **Modularity** – Each component is self-contained yet interoperable  

Start anywhere. Follow your instincts. The repo is designed to reward exploration.
