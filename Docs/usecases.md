## üîó Linking Cyber Care to Recon-Suite

Cyber Care is built on modular, auditable principles‚Äîmany of which were first prototyped in Recon-Suite. This document links to example modules that demonstrate how ethical cybersecurity can be delivered in practice.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The linked Recon-Suite repository is public and outlines the conceptual framework only. Detailed implementation, including privileged diagnostics and contributor tooling, resides in a private repository for security and stewardship reasons.

- **[Recon-Suite README](https://github.com/Mark-a-Hamilton/Recon-Suite/blob/main/README.md):** Select the link to navigate to the **Recon Suite Public** repository

If you're a contributor or stakeholder, feel free to explore all modules to understand how Cyber Care translates ethical theory into operational clarity.

Would you like to add a VC-log entry for this linkage, or scaffold a contributor note explaining why the private repo remains closed-source? I can also help draft a permissions philosophy if you're preparing for stakeholder review.
