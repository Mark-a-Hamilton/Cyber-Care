# üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with Cyber Care

Welcome to Cyber Care ‚Äî a modular, ethical framework for delivering cybersecurity in a way that's transparent, auditable, and accessible to non-technical audiences.

This guide will help you clone the repository, prepare your environment, and understand the boundaries of what Cyber Care does (and doesn‚Äôt do).

---

## üì¶ Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the Cyber Care public repo to your local machine:

```

This will give you access to all documentation, onboarding templates, and example workflows.

## üß∞ Environment Preparation

Cyber Care is platform-agnostic, but here are a few setup tips:

- **WSL/Kali Users**: Ensure your distro is updated and has access to basic shell utilities.
- **Windows Users**: PowerShell may require execution policy adjustments for local scripts.
- **Optional**: Set up a virtual environment or container if you plan to extend functionality.

No privileged modules or external dependencies are required.

## ü§ñ Optional AI Scaffolding

If you're using AI tools to assist with documentation or workflow design:

- All AI-generated content should be versioned and reviewable.

## üö´ Operational Boundaries

**Important: This repository does *not* include Recon-Suite tools or any privileged modules.**

Cyber Care is a documentation and onboarding framework only. It is designed to teach, scaffold, and empower‚Äînot to execute diagnostics or remediation.

For operational tooling, refer to internal repositories with appropriate access and consent protocols.

Cyber Care is the cockpit, not the engine room.
