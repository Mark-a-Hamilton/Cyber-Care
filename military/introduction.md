# 🛡️ Introduction: Applying the Cyber Care Model to Military Strategy

## 🎯 Purpose

To meaningfully apply the Cyber Care model to military strategy, we must first understand:

1. **The Environment** — geopolitical constraints and power dynamics  
2. **The Current System** — how warfare is structured and resourced today  
3. **Required Changes** — what must evolve to align with ethical, scalable defence  
4. **Resource Feasibility** — whether the transformation is achievable and sustainable  

Cyber Care is not just a software model—it’s a mindset. Once adopted, it offers a framework that can be applied across societal challenges, including national defence.

## 🌍 Environment: Strategic Constraints by Governance Type

Global politics is shaped by two dominant governance models:

- **Democracies** — Accountable to their electorate, constrained by law, ethics, and transparency.  
- **Autocracies** — Unaccountable to citizens, unconstrained by oversight or international norms.

This asymmetry creates a strategic vulnerability: democracies must defend within ethical bounds, while autocracies exploit the absence of such limits. What appears as weakness is, in fact, a principled constraint—and Cyber Care seeks to turn that constraint into strategic advantage.

## ⚔️ Current System: Warfare by Attrition

Modern warfare is dominated by resource-heavy states—primarily the US, Russia, and China—whose advantage stems from scale, not strategy. The prevailing model favors:

- Expensive platforms: ships, submarines, aircraft, missile systems  
- High-cost engagements: millions per strike, long logistics chains  
- Exclusion of smaller states: priced out unless backed by major powers  

This system rewards brute force over ethical innovation, and entrenches inequality in global defence capabilities.

## 🔄 Required Changes: Toward Ethical, Scalable Defence

Technology now enables a shift from attrition to agility. The Cyber Care mindset reframes defence as:

- **Modular** — Replace monolithic systems with scalable, interoperable tools  
- **Cost-efficient** — Use drones, autonomous sensors, and laser weapons (e.g. £1–£10 per shot vs. millions)  
- **Tiered response** — Detect threats early and respond proportionally, minimizing escalation  
- **Distributed protection** — States collaborate to extend layered deterrence across shared borders  

This isn’t just cheaper—it’s smarter, more ethical, and more inclusive.

## ✅ Sufficient Resources: Reframing the Question

The real question is no longer *“Can we afford to change?”*  
It’s *“Can we afford not to?”*

By adopting Cyber Care principles, even smaller states can:

- Nullify brute-force advantages  
- Scale defence through collaboration  
- Maintain ethical boundaries without sacrificing resilience  

This mindset transforms defence from a privilege of the powerful into a civic responsibility shared across nations.
