# üõ°Ô∏è National Security Scenario

## üéØ Purpose

This scenario demonstrates how the Cyber Care mindset‚Äîoriginally framed through household security‚Äîcan be scaled to national defence. By abstracting familiar zones into strategic equivalents, we preserve clarity, adaptability, and ethical framing.

## üó∫Ô∏è Zone Mapping: Household ‚Üí Nation

| Household Zone        | National Equivalent             | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outside Perimeter     | International Airspace & Waters | Passive surveillance; no jurisdiction but monitoring is lawful              |
| Inside Perimeter      | National Borders & EEZ          | Active deterrence; lawful defensive measures within sovereign territory     |
| Building Security     | Critical Infrastructure         | Escalation readiness; controlled access and robust protection               |
| Inside Building       | Civilian Population & Data      | Ethical defence; proportionality, legality, and accountability              |

## üîπ Zone 1: International Airspace & Waters (Outside Perimeter)

- **Function**: Early warning and passive surveillance  
- **Tools**:
  - Satellite imagery and radar sweeps
  - Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
  - Maritime and aerial patrols (non-intrusive)
- **Ethical Framing**: No engagement unless provoked; focus on transparency and deterrence

---

## üî∏ Zone 2: National Borders & Exclusive Economic Zone (Inside Perimeter)

- **Function**: Active deterrence and lawful defence  
- **Tools**:
  - Border sensors and autonomous patrol drones
  - Coast guard and air defence systems
  - Cyber perimeter monitoring (e.g., DNS, BGP anomalies)
- **Ethical Framing**: Proportional response; visible but non-escalatory posture

---

## üîπ Zone 3: Critical Infrastructure (Building Security)

- **Function**: Escalation readiness and controlled access  
- **Assets**:
  - Power grids, water systems, telecoms, transport hubs
  - Cyber Care modules for real-time diagnostics and lockdown protocols
  - Two-way authentication for system access (human + machine)
- **Ethical Framing**: Intent assessment before response; audit-grade traceability

---

## üî∏ Zone 4: Civilian Population & Data (Inside Building)

- **Function**: Ethical defence of citizens and civic systems  
- **Assets**:
  - Personal data protection (GDPR, encryption, zero-trust)
  - Emergency response coordination
  - Civic education and misinformation countermeasures
- **Ethical Framing**: Defence within reason; uphold rights, avoid overreach

---

## üß© Summary: Strategic Scaling

This national model retains the Cyber Care ethos:
- **Modularity**: Each zone is independently auditable and adaptable  
- **Ethics**: Defence is always proportional, lawful, and transparent  
- **Contributor Empowerment**: Civilian and allied input is welcomed, not sidelined  
- **Resilience**: The system adapts to threats without compromising values
