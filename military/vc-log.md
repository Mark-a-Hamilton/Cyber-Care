### üìÑ `introduction.md` Creation  
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Author:** Mark Hamilton  
**Action:** Created `introduction.md` to scaffold the military model‚Äôs purpose, scope, and ethical framing.  
**Details:**  
- Outlined the rationale for Cyber Care‚Äôs military module‚Äîbridging strategic defence with ethical stewardship.  
- Defined contributor expectations and modular design principles.  
- Linked to Recon-Suite foundations and clarified auditability goals.  
**Impact:** Establishes a clear entry point for non-technical stakeholders and future contributors.  
**Next Steps:** Cross-link with `concept.md` and onboarding flows.

### üß† `concept.md` Creation  
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Author:** Mark Hamilton  
**Action:** Drafted `concept.md` to articulate the proof-of-concept for Cyber Care‚Äôs military model.  
**Details:**  
- Introduced layered deterrence and scalable autonomy as core strategic themes.  
- Framed ethical engagement protocols and contributor roles.  
- Included analogies for civic and technical audiences to foster shared understanding.  
**Impact:** Serves as a bridge between strategic vision and operational modules.  
**Next Steps:** Expand with scenario walkthroughs and link to `hardware.md`.

### üîß `hardware.md` Creation  
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Author:** Mark Hamilton  
**Action:** Created `hardware.md` to document physical components and deployment contexts.  
**Details:**  
- Listed candidate hardware for autonomous drone integration and field diagnostics.  
- Flagged modularity, resilience, and ethical constraints in hardware selection.  
- Included contributor notes for testing, sourcing, and fallback protocols.  
**Impact:** Anchors the technical feasibility of the military model in real-world constraints.  
**Next Steps:** Add diagrams, link to `concept.md`, and validate against Recon-Suite compatibility.

### üìÅ Modular Navigation Scaffold  
**Date:** 2025-08-27  
**Author:** Mark Hamilton  
**Action:** Structured modular navigation across `cybercare/military` documents for contributor clarity and circular referencing.  
**Details:**  
- Designated `introduction.md` as the single entry point for the military model, linking to both `evolution.md` and the Cyber Care root `README.md`.  
- Implemented `evolution.md` as a modular index, providing plain-English summaries for each military module before linking to their respective documents.  
- Enabled circular navigation: each module (e.g., `concept.md`, `hardware.md`, `extend.md`, `national.md`) includes return links to `evolution.md` and/or `introduction.md` to preserve contributor orientation.  
- Reinforces Cyber Care‚Äôs onboarding philosophy‚Äîclarity before complexity, modularity before depth.  
**Impact:**  
- Enhances traceability and contributor autonomy.  
- Reduces onboarding friction for non-technical users.  
- Aligns with Cyber Care‚Äôs principle of ethical accessibility and adaptive documentation.  
**Next Steps:**  
- Consider adding breadcrumb blocks or visual flow diagrams to further support navigation.  
- Audit backlink integrity across all modules to ensure consistency.
