# 🛸 Aerial Surveillance Vehicle Specification (Doctrine-Agnostic)

## 🔧 **Core Design Philosophy**
- **Mission-first architecture**: Vehicle designed around surveillance, triage, and ethical autonomy—not retrofitted from existing platforms.
- **Modular payload bays**: Swappable modules for sensors, comms, defence, and power.
- **Crew-agnostic control**: Remote operators from fixed or mobile bases; no onboard crew.

---

## 🧠 **Autonomous Threat Triage**
- **Non-broadcast detection**: Uses flight plan deviation, radar signature, and behavioral anomalies.
- **Local threat scoring**: Onboard database of aircraft types, known flight paths, and restricted zones.
- **Escalation logic**: Z-style schema for alert levels, engagement thresholds, and override protocols.

---

## 🛰️ **Surveillance & Target Painting**
- **EO/IR sensors**: For visual tracking and laser designation.
- **Passive radar**: For stealthy detection without emissions.
- **Target painting**: Compatible with JTAC, aircraft, and drone-based precision guidance.

---

## 🔋 **Power & Propulsion**
- **Solar-assisted flight profiles**: Optimized for loitering and endurance.
- **Battery redundancy**: Supports high-energy bursts (e.g., laser discharge).
- **Quiet propulsion**: For stealth and civilian airspace compliance.

---

## 🧩 **Comms & Control**
- **Distributed control architecture**: Multi-node command with fallback redundancy.
- **Containerized ground stations**: Deployable to airbases, ships, or hardened bunkers.
- **Contributor-friendly interface**: Modular diagnostics, privilege-aware scripting, and audit-grade logging.

---

## 🛡️ **Defensive Systems**
- **Laser deterrence pod**: Scalable arrays for drone neutralization and sensor blinding.
- **EM shielding**: Protects against jamming and spoofing.
- **Fail-safe protocols**: Autonomous return-to-base or self-neutralization on compromise.

---

## 📜 **Ethical & Legal Compliance**
- **Audit-grade VC logs**: Every decision traceable and reviewable.
- **Contributor empowerment**: Clear onboarding, modular diagnostics, and teachable scaffolds.
- **Civilian airspace ethics**: No reliance on IFF; respects ATC protocols and public safety.

# 🌊🛥️ **Maritime Surface/Subsurface Surveillance Vehicle Specification**

## 🔧 **Core Design Philosophy**
- **Mission-adaptive hull**: Hydrodynamic for surface cruising, hydrophilic for submersion.
- **Modular payload architecture**: Sensor pods, comms arrays, and power units swappable based on mission.
- **Crew-agnostic control**: Fully remote-operated with fallback autonomy.

---

## 🧠 **Dual-Mode Threat Triage**
- **Surface Mode**:
  - AIS tracking and spoof detection
  - EO/IR surveillance for visual ID and target painting
  - Passive radar for low-emission detection
- **Subsurface Mode**:
  - Passive and active sonar for underwater object classification
  - Magnetometers for hull detection
  - Acoustic anomaly detection (e.g., propeller signatures, cable tampering)

Each mode runs its own **local triage logic**, with shared escalation schema and VC logging.

---

## 🔋 **Power & Propulsion**
- **Hybrid propulsion system**:
  - Surface: solar-assisted electric motors
  - Subsurface: battery-powered pump-jet or ducted fans
- **Energy management**:
  - Surface recharge cycles
  - Smart routing to optimize power use based on mission phase

---

## 🧩 **Comms & Control**
- **Surface comms**:
  - Satellite uplink, encrypted burst transmissions
- **Subsurface comms**:
  - Acoustic modems, surfacing relays, or tethered buoys
- **Distributed control architecture**:
  - Ground stations on ships, coastal bases, or mobile containers

---

## 🛡️ **Defensive Systems**
- **Surface deterrence**:
  - Laser pods for drone neutralization
  - EM shielding
- **Subsurface deterrence**:
  - Acoustic jammers
  - Sonar blinding pulses
- **Fail-safe protocols**:
  - Autonomous surfacing or return-to-base
  - Self-neutralization if compromised

---

## 📜 **Ethical & Legal Compliance**
- **Audit-grade VC logs** across both modes
- **Contributor-friendly diagnostics** and scripting
- **Civilian maritime ethics**:
  - No interference with legal vessels or fishing
  - Respect for international maritime law and sovereignty

---

# 🧬 Strategic Impact

This hybrid vehicle becomes a **multi-domain node** the surveillance mesh is capable of:

- Patrolling surface shipping lanes
- Diving to inspect subsea infrastructure
- Triaging threats across both domains
- Operating ethically, transparently, and autonomously
